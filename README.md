Software design patters document commonly occuring problems and their solution in a certain context.

"Each pattern is a three-part rule, which expresses a relation between a certain context, a certain system
of forces which occurs repeatedly in that context, and a certain software configuration which allows these
forces to resolve themselves." - Richard Gabriel
