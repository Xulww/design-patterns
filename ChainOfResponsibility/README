In this pattern there are objects who are lined up one after another. Each of them knows the one
that's after him. This type of chaining means that its enough to have information about
the first object only because the second knows about the first, the third about the second and so
on. This implies that we have access to the whole chain through only one object - the first one.
Usually a message or some data is sent through the foremost one and its expected one of the 
objects in the chain to process/handle it.

In theory each object in the chain can handle the message as long as, for example, some condition is 
met. If not the message is passed on to the next object.
