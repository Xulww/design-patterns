Sometimes you need to have a connection between different types of objects. These objects communicate with each
other, and their count gets bigger with time. At some point, if you want to add a new functionality to an object,
you will have to change the rest of the objects too because they are interconnected.

In order of the objects to not be directly connected between each other but to go through an extra layer, which
takes care of this connection, you need a mediator.

This way the refactoring of the objects is going to be easier and also if you have to change something with the
communication, you know where to do it.
