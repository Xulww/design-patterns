The observer pattern has two types of objects - observable and observers.

Observable - the object/value that is changing.
Observer - keeping track if there are changes in the objects it's connected to.

Usually the relationship between the objects in the observer pattern is one to many
because it has one object that's notifying and changing the rest of the objects.
