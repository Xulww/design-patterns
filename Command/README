The idea of the command pattern is to observe the sequence of actions that have been done on
a certain object. This way you can go forward or back an action.

There are 3 types of participants - receiver (the command target), invoker (the command executer)
and command (the task).

In this example the lights are the receiver and the remote is the invoker.
